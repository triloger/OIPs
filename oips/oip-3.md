## Simple Summary

Add new long Synths for four new cryptocurrencies: 
- Link (LINK)
- AAVE (AAVE)
- Defi Pulse Index (DPI)
- Polygon (MATIC)

## Motivation

Adding long exposure to a range of new Synths will allow traders to speculate on the value of some of the best-known tokens in the ecosystem. The intentions is to attract more traders to Oikos.Exchange by adding to the growing list of available Synths. It's important to attract new traders to the platform, as the protocol is built around rewarding OKS stakers with fees generated by trading volume.

## Specification

These Synths will be implemented in much the same way as the other long crypto Synths.

## Rationale

Additional crypto Synths will add further utility to the Oikos network. The included assets are available in our Chainlink feed https://data.chain.link/users/oikos-cash
## Test Cases

## Implementation

As proposal is approved, these Synths will be added.
